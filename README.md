Full Metal Stencil
---
Use a fiber laser to convert clean aluminum business cards into PCB stencils quickly. 

I've used mylar and brass for PCB stencils. I've dialed-in settings with CNC and CO2 lasers. They all work, but this method yields faster, more reliable and higher quality results than my previous combinations.

The downside? Fiber lasers are still relatively expensive.

Why metal business cards? 

* inexpensive ( $0.15 each ) 
* just the right thickness ( 0.8mm )
* stay flat ( brass rolls flip up )
* most of my PCBs are breakouts are small
* they look good
